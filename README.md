# LCP-Finder
Implement the skew algorithm to construct suffix array in O(n) time complexity and then find the longest common prefix array with Kauai's algorithm in linear time.

### Usage
First, Complile the main.cpp to executable file if needed.
Second, given a selected input DNA sequence as argument, the program will output the suffix array and LCP array.
```
./main seq.fasta
```

### Memo
The  ``n`` in  seq``n``.fasta file represent the number of nucleotide in the DNA sequence
